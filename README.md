# NBA Gamefinder project

Uses the BallDontLie API to grab a list of all teams and create a dynamic sortable table of the teams. Clicking on a team will grab a random game from the 2021 season. May implement ability to select season soon.

Made for practice. Uses some bootstrap elements, reactive display + mobile friendly.
