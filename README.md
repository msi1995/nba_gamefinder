# Alkira UI Engineer Takehome

To the devs at Alkira who review my implementation, thank you for the opportunity. I included just a few comments in areas of the code that I know may have room for improvement, but I did not want to spend an unrealistic amount of time on the takehome.

I used a third-party side panel (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sliding-side-panel) that ended up not functioning as well as I would have liked. You'll notice a slight delay when closing the sidebar. I tried to fix this for a bit, but wasn't able to find a quick solution.

I believe all other functionality is present as requested including the extra credit searches/sorting. I added a bit of extra flair to the design, as well as some loading indicators for data retrieval for the side panel -- hopefully this is okay.


Thanks!
